# To-do list

Everyone's favorite React project!

There are about a thousand tutorials on React that include creating a "to do" list, and with good reason. Making a way for users to create,manipulate, and display data in a way that makes sense describes most of web development.

This project was not made from any example video or tutorial. At this point, I wanted to do a "to do" list from scratch without a guide.

Since this is mainly for practice with React, all information is kept on the client side.

To have some degree of permanence, the list will be kept client-side.

## App structure

A simple to-do app could probably all be done in the App.js file. However, to get some exercise passing props around and dealing with some structure, each item is its own component (ListItem).

## DayJS

In anticipation of using reminders, DayJS has been downloaded to deal with dates and times.
